# Phase 1 MVP Tasks for Deep Research Crew

discovery_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the research query: "{query}"
    
    Break down the query into specific research questions, identify key concepts,
    and determine the most relevant sources to investigate. Create a comprehensive research plan
    that outlines which documents to prioritize and what key insights to look for.
    
    Consider the date range ({start_date} to {end_date}) and source types: {sources}
  expected_output: >
    A structured research plan with:
    - 3-5 specific research questions derived from the query
    - List of prioritized source types and search strategies
    - Key concepts and entities to track
    - Success criteria for the research
  agent: research_lead

literature_mining_task:
  description: >
    Based on the research plan, find and process relevant documents about "{query}".
    
    Use the PDF parser and web scraper tools to extract structured information from
    up to {max_docs} documents. For each document, extract:
    - Title, authors, and metadata
    - Abstract and key sections (methods, results, conclusions)
    - Citations and references
    - Datasets and code repositories mentioned
    
    Focus on high-quality sources published between {start_date} and {end_date}.
  expected_output: >
    A collection of structured documents with:
    - Full metadata and provenance
    - Extracted sections and content
    - Citations and references
    - Identified datasets and code links
    Format as JSON list of Document objects
  agent: literature_miner

claim_extraction_task:
  description: >
    Extract key insights, arguments, and data from the processed documents.
    
    Analyze each document's content and identify:
    - Key arguments and theoretical positions
    - Empirical findings and statistical data
    - Methodological innovations
    - Contradictions or agreements with other sources
    
    For each insight, capture:
    - The exact text with context
    - Type of insight (empirical, theoretical, methodological)
    - Provenance (source, page, section)
  expected_output: >
    A list of extracted insights with full provenance:
    - Insight ID and text
    - Insight type
    - Source document and location
    - Context from surrounding text
    Format as JSON list of Insight objects
  agent: literature_miner

deep_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the extracted insights to identify trends, patterns, and underlying themes.
    
    Synthesize the information to answer the research questions.
    1. Identify consensus and dissensus among sources
    2. Connect dots between disparate pieces of information
    3. Evaluate the strength of evidence for different claims
    4. Construct a coherent narrative or argument
  expected_output: >
    A synthesized analysis of the topic including:
    - Key themes and patterns
    - Areas of agreement and disagreement
    - Critical evaluation of the evidence
    - Strategic insights and implications
    Format as a structured Analysis object
  agent: senior_analyst

report_generation_task:
  description: >
    Create a comprehensive research report synthesizing all findings.
    
    The report should include:
    1. Executive Summary
       - High-level overview and strategic takeaways
    
    2. In-Depth Analysis
       - Detailed exploration of key themes
       - Synthesis of evidence from multiple sources
       - Discussion of implications
    
    3. Methodology and Sources
       - Description of the research process
       - List of all sources with metadata
    
    Use clear, professional language. Make the report authoritative and accessible.
  expected_output: >
    A complete research report in Markdown format with:
    - Executive summary
    - Deep analysis sections
    - Full source documentation
    Save to file: research_report.md
  agent: report_composer
  output_file: research_report.md
