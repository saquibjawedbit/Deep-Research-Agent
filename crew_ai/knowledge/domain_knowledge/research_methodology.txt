Research Methodology Best Practices

This knowledge base contains best practices for conducting deep research:

1. Multi-Source Verification
   - Always cross-reference claims with at least 2-3 independent sources
   - Prioritize peer-reviewed publications and official documentation
   - Be cautious of single-source claims

2. Source Credibility Assessment
   - Check author credentials and institutional affiliations
   - Verify publication dates for currency of information
   - Look for potential conflicts of interest

3. Evidence Hierarchy
   - Systematic reviews and meta-analyses (highest quality)
   - Randomized controlled trials
   - Cohort and case-control studies
   - Expert opinions and case reports (lowest quality)

4. Citation Practices
   - Always provide complete citations with URLs
   - Verify that citations actually support the claims made
   - Track citation networks to identify seminal works

5. Knowledge Synthesis
   - Identify common themes across multiple sources
   - Resolve contradictions by examining methodology differences
   - Note areas of consensus vs. ongoing debate
